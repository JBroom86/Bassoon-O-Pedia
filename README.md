<h1>User Stories</h1>
<p>As a bassoonists, I want to use Bassoon-O-Pedia to find out more about specific instruments so that I can have a history of either my instrument or an instrument I would like to buy.</p>
<p>As a instrument repair tech, I would use Bassoon-O-Pedia as a way to see past repairs and history of the instrument.</p>

<h1>Unsolved Mysteries</h1>
<p>The aoplication was originally going to have a database of musicians linking to specific instruments that they played. However, I was unable to get the routes to populate correctly and display information from the database. Instead of linking musicians to specific instruments I created a "Media" database to store examples of musicians peforming on different types of instruments. I found this solution to be a bit more interesting because if provide an audible example of the capabilites and qualities of the various model types. <em>I may expand on this section in the future to add a feature to where individuals can submit recording of themselves playing various models of bassoons.</em></p>
